        <h1>Why Most Roofer Marketing Fails (And How to Fix It)</h1>
        <p>The 5 reasons your marketing budget is burning cash instead of generating signed contracts</p>
    </div>

    <article class="container">
        <div class="meta">Published February 11, 2026 • 8 min read</div>

        <p>You're spending $3,000/month on Google Ads. Your truck lettering cost $2,500. You've got yard signs in every completed job. You're listed on Angi, HomeAdvisor, and Thumbtack. You're running Facebook ads.</p>

        <p>And somehow, you're still scrambling for jobs. The phone rings, but half the calls are price shoppers who go with the cheapest guy. Your close rate is maybe 30%. You're working harder but not growing.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, that roofer who started a year after you is booked solid 8 weeks out, charging 20% more, and turning down work.</p>

        <p><strong>What's the difference?</strong> It's not better ads. It's not a bigger budget. It's not even better roofing work.</p>

        <p>The difference is they have a system. You have tactics.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <strong>The Hard Truth</strong>
            Your marketing isn't failing because Google Ads don't work or because HomeAdvisor leads are garbage. It's failing because you're pouring leads into a broken bucket. Fix the bucket first, then the marketing will work.
        </div>

        <h2>The 5 Reasons Roofing Marketing Fails</h2>

        <h3>Reason 1: You're Optimizing for Leads Instead of Signed Contracts</h3>

        <p>Most roofers measure marketing success by lead volume: "We got 60 leads this month!"</p>

        <p>But here's the problem: <strong>leads don't pay your bills. Signed contracts do.</strong></p>

        <p>If you're getting 60 leads but only closing 18 jobs, your real conversion rate is 30%. That means 70% of your marketing spend is wasted. But you don't know which 70%, so you keep spending on everything.</p>

        <p><strong>Why this happens:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You respond when you can (which means you miss 50% of calls because you're on a roof)</li>
            <li>You send quotes but don't systematically follow up if they don't sign immediately</li>
            <li>You have no idea which lead sources actually result in signed contracts (just which ones generate "activity")</li>
            <li>You're tracking leads, not revenue</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Stop counting leads. Start counting signed contracts by source. Your Google Ads might generate 40 leads but only 8 jobs. Your referrals might generate 8 leads but 6 jobs. Suddenly you know where to double down and where to cut.</p>

        <h3>Reason 2: Your Follow-Up is Basically Non-Existent</h3>

        <p>Homeowner requests a quote. You inspect the roof, send an estimate for $14,500. They say "Let me think about it and get a few more quotes."</p>

        <p>You say "Sure, call me when you're ready!" and move on to the next lead. You maybe follow up once if you remember. They never call back.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, they signed with a roofer who followed up 7 times over 3 weeks with educational content, financing options, and limited-time incentives.</p>

        <p><strong>The brutal reality:</strong> 80% of roofing sales happen after the 5th follow-up attempt. Most roofers don't make it past attempt #1.</p>

        <div class="comparison">
            <h3>The Reality of Follow-Up</h3>
            <div class="before-after">
                <div class="before">
                    <h4>Without a System</h4>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                        <li>Inspect roof, send quote</li>
                        <li>Homeowner says "I'll think about it"</li>
                        <li>Maybe call back once if you remember</li>
                        <li>Assume they went with someone else</li>
                        <li>Move on to next lead</li>
                        <li><strong>Result: 25% close rate</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="after">
                    <h4>With a System</h4>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                        <li>Inspect roof, send detailed digital quote</li>
                        <li>Automated follow-up at day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21</li>
                        <li>Educational content (roof lifespan, insurance claims, financing)</li>
                        <li>Customer testimonials and recent project photos</li>
                        <li>Limited-time incentives that create urgency</li>
                        <li><strong>Result: 55-65% close rate</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Automate your follow-up. Every quote gets a pre-written sequence of emails and texts that educate, build trust, and make it easy to sign. You just respond when they're ready to book.</p>

        <h3>Reason 3: You're Competing on Price (The Death Spiral)</h3>

        <p>Homeowner gets 4 quotes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Roofer A: $16,200 (detailed proposal, digital inspection report, warranty info, financing options, reviews)</li>
            <li>Roofer B: $14,800 (email quote, one-line description)</li>
            <li>Roofer C: $13,500 (handwritten quote on torn paper)</li>
            <li>You: $14,200 (trying to be "competitive")</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Homeowner picks Roofer C (cheapest). You lost. But worse—you've trained yourself to compete on price instead of value.</p>

        <p><strong>Why this kills profitability:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You're attracting price shoppers (lowest quality customers)</li>
            <li>You're cutting margin to win jobs (barely profitable or losing money)</li>
            <li>You're commoditizing yourself (no differentiation = always competing on price)</li>
            <li>You can't invest in growth (no profit = no marketing budget = can't scale)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Stop competing on price. Compete on value, trust, and professionalism:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Digital inspection reports:</strong> Photos/videos of every problem area (shows professionalism)</li>
            <li><strong>Detailed proposals:</strong> Itemized breakdown, material specs, warranty details (builds confidence)</li>
            <li><strong>Social proof:</strong> Reviews, before/after photos, referrals from neighbors (creates trust)</li>
            <li><strong>Financing options:</strong> "As low as $185/month" (removes price objection)</li>
            <li><strong>Guarantees:</strong> Workmanship warranty, satisfaction guarantee (reduces risk)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you present value instead of just price, you can charge 15-25% more and win.</p>

        <h3>Reason 4: You're Ignoring Your Most Valuable Asset (Past Customers)</h3>

        <p>You complete a roof replacement. Customer loves it. You get paid. And then... you never talk to them again.</p>

        <p>Why? Because you're too busy chasing new leads from Google Ads and HomeAdvisor.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, that customer knows 20 homeowners in their neighborhood. Half of them have roofs that are 15+ years old. But you never asked for referrals. You never stayed in touch. They forgot about you.</p>

        <p><strong>The math that will haunt you:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you complete 50 jobs per year for 3 years, you have 150 past customers</li>
            <li>If each past customer knows 20 homeowners, that's 3,000 potential referrals</li>
            <li>If just 5% need a roof in the next year, that's 150 potential jobs</li>
            <li><strong>That's 150 warm referrals you're not getting because you don't have a referral system</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Automate your past customer engagement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request reviews immediately after job completion</li>
            <li>Offer referral incentives ("Refer a neighbor, get $300 when they sign")</li>
            <li>Send annual roof maintenance reminders (builds goodwill + catches problems early)</li>
            <li>Send storm damage alerts after major weather events ("We're in your area – free inspection")</li>
            <li>Create neighborhood marketing campaigns (yard sign in customer's yard + canvass neighbors)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reason 5: You Have No Idea What's Actually Working</h3>

        <p>Quick: which marketing channel generated the most revenue last quarter?</p>

        <p>If you can't answer that in 10 seconds with actual numbers, you're flying blind.</p>

        <p>Most roofers "know" that Google Ads "kind of work" and that yard signs "bring in some leads." But they have no actual data. So they keep spending money on everything and hoping for the best.</p>

        <p><strong>The fix:</strong> Track everything. Your system should tell you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cost per lead by channel</li>
            <li>Lead-to-inspection conversion rate by channel</li>
            <li>Inspection-to-quote conversion rate</li>
            <li>Quote-to-close conversion rate</li>
            <li>Average job value by channel</li>
            <li>ROI by channel (revenue ÷ marketing spend)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you have this data, decisions become obvious: "Google Ads costs $85/lead but converts at 35% with a $13,000 average job = $4,550 profit per lead. HomeAdvisor costs $45/lead but converts at 12% with a $9,500 average job = $1,140 profit per lead. I should spend more on Google Ads."</p>

        <h2>The Real Problem: Tactics vs. Systems</h2>

        <p>Here's what most roofers do when marketing isn't working: they try new tactics.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Google Ads not working? Try Facebook Ads.</li>
            <li>Facebook not working? Try HomeAdvisor.</li>
            <li>HomeAdvisor not working? Try direct mail.</li>
            <li>Direct mail not working? Try door knocking.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The problem isn't the tactic. The problem is you're pouring leads into a broken system that loses 70% of them.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <strong>The System Comes First</strong>
            A roofer with a great system and mediocre marketing will close 28 jobs from 50 leads (56% conversion). A roofer with great marketing and no system will close 12 jobs from 50 leads (24% conversion). Same 50 leads. 233% more revenue. The difference is the system.
        </div>

        <h2>What a Working System Looks Like</h2>

        <div class="comparison">
            <div class="before-after">
                <div class="before">

        <h2>What to Do Next</h2>

        <p>You have two choices:</p>

        <p><strong>Choice 1:</strong> Keep trying new marketing tactics and hoping one finally works. Keep losing 70% of leads. Keep competing on price. Keep wondering why you're working so hard and not growing.</p>

        <p><strong>Choice 2:</strong> Fix the system first. Build infrastructure that captures every lead, responds instantly, follows up automatically, and tracks everything. Then your marketing—whatever channel you choose—will actually work.</p>
